What is DNS in networking?

DNS stands for Domain Name System
It works like the phone book for the internet.
DNS is a heirarchial host naming system connected to the internet or any private network
The process involves converting the domain names of participating entities or hosts to a computer friendly IP addresses.
When ever you connect to the internet, the DNS server that you use automatically established by your network provider.

What is Ping?

A ping is a software utility used to verify the rechangability of a specific IP address on a network.
It works by sending internet control message protocol (ICMP) echo request to the host of a destination computer and then waiting for an echo reply.
The ping is initiated serveral times to get responses echoed back to the resource provided information such as 
"Bytes sent and recieved / Packet sent, recieved or lost".

What is Port in Networking?

A port is a communication endpoint in networking throught which information flows from a program on the computer to another computer on the network.
It is like a docking point where all the private boats are docked.
Post are numbered, and each port is associated with different service.
The allow computers to differentiate between different kinds of incoming and outgoing traffic over the same network connections.
Some ports are reserved for specific protocols:

HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) uses port 80
FTP(File Transfer protocol) uses port 21
Email received on a local computer used TCP port 25

Each host can have 65535 ports per IP address, and then use of these ports is managed by IANA(Internet Assigned Number Authority).

What is DHCP in Networking?

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
It is a network protocol used an IP address to automate the process of configuring devices and allow for seemless communication on the network.
A DHCP server automatically assign IP addresses to each host on the network, thus allowing them to use the services such as SNS and many other communication protocols to communicate with other endpoints.
Using DHCP, IP conflicts are reduced and it is easy to change adresses or endpoints.

What is socket in Networking?

A socket is a software structure that allows for communication between two or more programs on the same or different machines within a network node.
It can be seen as the endpoint of two-way communication commonly used in client-server application.
A socket that can be created by linking the IP number of a system with a software port number where IP number and port numbers are seperated by a

What are the HTTP & the HTTPS protocol?

HTTP is the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol which defined the set of rules and standards on how the information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web.
It helps the web browsers and web servers for communication.
It is a stateless protocol where each command is independent with respect to the previous command.
HTTP is an application layer protocol built upon the TCP, it used by by default port 80.
HTTPS is the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure.
It is an advanced and secured version of HTTP.
It enables secure transactions by encrypting the communication ans also help identify network servers securely.
It uses port 443 by default.

What is the SMTP Protocol?

SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
SMTP set the rules for communication between servers. This set of rules help the software to transmit emails over the internt.
It supports the both end-end and store-and-forward methods.
It is always listening mode on port 25.
It always works with pop3-Post office protocol-helps clients synchronize mails.
