What is Port in Networking?

A port is a communication endpoint in networking throught which information flows from a program on the computer to another computer on the network.
It is like a docking point where all the private boats are docked.
Post are numbered, and each port is associated with different service.
The allow computers to differentiate between different kinds of incoming and outgoing traffic over the same network connections.
Some ports are reserved for specific protocols:

HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) uses port 80
FTP(File Transfer protocol) uses port 21
Email received on a local computer used TCP port 25

Each host can have 65535 ports per IP address, and then use of these ports is managed by IANA(Internet Assigned Number Authority).

What is DHCP in Networking?

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
It is a network protocol used an IP address to automate the process of configuring devices and allow for seemless communication on the network.
A DHCP server automatically assign IP addresses to each host on the network, thus allowing them to use the services such as SNS and many other communication protocols to communicate with other endpoints.
Using DHCP, IP conflicts are reduced and it is easy to change adresses or endpoints.
